    <h3 id="introTextMainPg">Do you hate losing recipes or scrolling endlessly through a food bloggers website, only to think you've reached the end,
      <br> but alas, one more story about the time they made cookies with their great aunt's sister-in-law by divorce? 
      <br> 
      <br> Do your bookmarks look like a cookbook exploded on your browser, leaving behind a digital kitchen disaster? 
      <br>
      <br>
      Scroll and cry no more, CulinaryCache has the answer to these problems.</h3>
